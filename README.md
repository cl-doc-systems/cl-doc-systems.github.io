# Common Lisp Documentation Builders

## Table of Contents


###### \[in package SITE\]
This site's goal is to help you to choose a Common Lisp
documentation builder suited your needs.

There are separate repositories with example projects.
Each project uses a different documentation builder.
But all projects are similar in their structure. All of them
define a few packages, functions and classes.

Here is a list of documentation builders along with their main strengths:

### cl-api

- Really simple.

- Readable color scheme.

- No way to write free documentation chapters.

[Template](https://github.com/cl-doc-systems/cl-api), [demo](https://cl-doc-systems.github.io/cl-api/).

### cl-gendoc

- You can write an extensions to support markups other than Markdown.

- Links to HyperSpec from code snippets.

[Template](https://github.com/cl-doc-systems/cl-gendoc), [demo](https://cl-doc-systems.github.io/cl-gendoc/).

### codex

- Supports different themes.

- Custom markup format, but you can extend it with other markups.

- Links to HyperSpec using special tag.

[Template](https://github.com/cl-doc-systems/codex), [demo](https://cl-doc-systems.github.io/codex/).

### coo

- Uses reStructured text format.

- New types of reST blocks can be written in Common Lisp.

- Provides cross-reference helpers.

### eazy-documentation

- Unique docstring parser which is works with custom forms.

### geneva

- Custom markup format [mk2](https://inters.co/geneva/mk2.html).

[Template](https://github.com/cl-doc-systems/geneva), [demo](https://cl-doc-systems.github.io/geneva/).

### mgl-pax

- Uses Markdown.

- Provides convenient cross-reference helpers.

- Has nice default scheme.

- Is able to generate not only HTML, but also a markdown README file.

- Nudge you too keep documentation as close to to the code as possible. You can define doc sections in the lisp files.

### staple

- You can reference symbol just by uppercasing.

- Complex to setup.

- Rendered documentation is nice.

- Can be problems with package inferred systems.

- No way to write free documentation chapters.

- Links to the doc sources on the github.
